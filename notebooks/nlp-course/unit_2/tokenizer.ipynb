    "Tokenizers are one of the core components of the NLP pipeline. They serve one purpose: to translate text into data that can be processed by the model. Models can only process numbers, so tokenizers need to convert our text inputs to numerical data. In this section, we’ll explore exactly what happens in the tokenization pipeline."

    "- split based on spaces\n",
    "- split based on punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Tokenizer gives decent results. There are also variations of word tokenizers that have extra rules for punctuation. With this kind of tokenizer, we can end up with some pretty large \"vocabularies\", where a vocabulary is defined by the total number of independent tokens that we have in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word gets assigned an ID, starting from 0 and going up to the size of the vocabulary. The model uses these IDs to identify each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the “unknown” token, often represented as ”[UNK]” or ”<unk>”. It’s generally a bad sign if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn’t able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you’re losing information along the way. The goal when crafting the vocabulary is to do it in such a way that the tokenizer tokenizes as few words as possible into the unknown token."

    "## Character-based Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Character-based tokenizers split the text into characters, rather than words. This has two primary benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vocabulary is much smaller.\n",
    "- There are much fewer out-of-vocabulary (unknown) tokens, since every word can be built from characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach isn’t perfect either. Since the representation is now based on characters rather than words, one could argue that, intuitively, it’s less meaningful: each character doesn’t mean a lot on its own, whereas that is the case with words. However, this again differs according to the language; in Chinese, for example, each character carries more information than a character in a Latin language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to consider is that we’ll end up with a very large amount of tokens to be processed by our model: whereas a word would only be a single token with a word-based tokenizer, it can easily turn into 10 or more tokens when converted into characters."

    "## Subword Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best of both worlds, we can use a third technique that combines the two approaches: subword tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword tokenization algorithms rely on the principle that frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, “annoyingly” might be considered a rare word and could be decomposed into “annoying” and “ly”. These are both likely to appear more frequently as standalone subwords, while at the same time the meaning of “annoyingly” is kept by the composite meaning of “annoying” and “ly”.\n",

To do this, the tokenizer has a vocabulary, which is the part we download when we instantiate it with the from_pretrained() method. Again, we need to use the same vocabulary used when the model was pretrained."
